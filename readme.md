# ava-cli

> Global CLI for AVA

This is a temporary fix for [AVA issue #245](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava/issues/245).
It is not likely to remain the permanent solution.


## Install

You must install `ava-cli` globally, and `ava` as a local dependency.

```
$ npm install -g ava-cli
$ npm install --save-dev ava
```

## Usage

Just run `ava` from inside your project directory. It will automatically find and use the locally installed version.
